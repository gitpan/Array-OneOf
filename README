NAME

    Array::OneOf -- checks if an element is in an array

SYNOPSIS

     use Array::OneOf ':all';
     
     # this test will pass
     if (oneof 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c') {
        # do stuff
     }
     
     # this test will not pass
     if (oneof 'x', 'a', 'b', 'c') {
        # do stuff
     }

DESCRIPTION

    Array::OneOf provides one simple utility, the oneof function. Its use
    is simple: if the first param is equal to any of the remaining params
    (in a string comparison), it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.

    In this module, undef is considered the same as undef, and not the same
    as any defined value. This is different than how most Perl programmers
    usually expect comparisons to work, so caveat programmer.

ALTERNATIVES

    Array::OneOf is not a particularly efficient way to test if a value is
    in an array. If efficiency is an important goal you may want to look at
    List::MoreUtils or Syntax::Keyword::Junction. You may also want to
    investigate using grep and/or the smart match operator (~~). I use
    Array::OneOf because it compares values the way my projects need them
    compared, its simple syntax, and small footprint.

INSTALLATION

    Array::OneOf can be installed with the usual routine:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install
